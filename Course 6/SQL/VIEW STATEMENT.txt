EXAMPLE:
1. Let’s create a view called EMPSALARY to display salary along with some basic sensitive data of employees 
from the HR database. 

CREATE VIEW EMPSALARY AS 
SELECT EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, B_DATE, SEX, SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEES; 

1a. Using SELECT, query the EMPSALARY view to retrieve all the records.

SELECT * FROM EMPSALARY;

2. 	Update a View
 a.	It now seems that the EMPSALARY view we created in exercise 1 doesn’t contain enough salary information, such as max/min salary and the job title of the employees. 
	Let’s update the EMPSALARY view:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW EMPSALARY  AS 
SELECT EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, B_DATE, SEX, JOB_TITLE, MIN_SALARY, MAX_SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEES, JOBS
WHERE EMPLOYEES.JOB_ID = JOBS.JOB_IDENT;

 b.	Using SELECT, query the updated EMPSALARY view to retrieve all the records.
	
SELECT * FROM EMPSALARY;

3.	Drop a View
 
 a.	DROP VIEW EMPSALARY;
 
 b. 	Using SELECT, you can verify whether the EMPSALARY view has been deleted or not.
	SELECT * FROM EMPSALARY;
